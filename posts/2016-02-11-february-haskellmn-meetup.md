The February HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, February 19,
2016, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, [Kyle Marek-Spartz](http://kyle.marek-spartz.org) will walk
through [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48
Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), a
[Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page) that introduces Haskell.

FYI: Saint Paul street parking is no longer free after 5pm, so you should be
able to park closer to the Hamm building, but you'll have to pay for that.

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221323299/).
