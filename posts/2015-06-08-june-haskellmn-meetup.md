The June HaskellMN Meetup will be *Tuesday*, June 16,
2015, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

Last month, [Andrew Clarkson](https://www.github.com/bitborn) recommended reading about and discussing persistent / immutable / purely-functional data structures. [Clojure's Vectors](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1) will be a good place to frame our discussion.

Other readings, if you're interested in more:

- [Persistent Data Structures on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)
- [Chris Okasaki's Thesis](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf)


Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221321241/).
