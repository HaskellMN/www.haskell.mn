The March HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, February 16,
2016, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, [Michael Hoy](https://github.com/mjhoy) is going to talk about his
first Haskell program, a [bot](https://github.com/mjhoy/chorebot_hs) to
distribute chores fairly among housemates every week. He'll discuss refactoring
the bot to implement randomness and configuration through a monad transformer
stack.

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221323302/).
