The November HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, November 18,
2015, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month we'll have a [Finish Your
Stuff](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9837915) Hack Night. Bring a project
you've been working on and want to finish. At the beginning of the meetup, tell
us a bit about your project. If you don't have a project, pair up with someone
with an interesting project.

[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221323291/).
