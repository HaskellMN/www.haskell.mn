The October HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, October 21,
2015, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, we're having an introduction to Haskell night. We'll get into small
groups, help you make sure Haskell is installed and configured on your laptop,
and work through some of [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221323289/).
