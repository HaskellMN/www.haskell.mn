The November HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 7-9 pm at
[GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the sixth floor of the Hamm
Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, Chris R. Timmons will give a presentation on Haskell's lazy
evaluation. Topics covered will include defining what laziness is, why Haskell's
designers chose to make it lazy, "normal form", and tools and techniques that
make reasoning about laziness easier.

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/235502442/).
