The April HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, April 15,
2015, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, we're going to talk about [Elm](http://www.elm-lang.org).

Some of us have started a game in Elm,
[Salem](https://github.com/HaskellMN/salem). Once we've chatted about how Elm
works, we'll break out into groups and hack on Salem.

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221321212/).
