The April HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, April 20,
2016, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, [Kyle Marek-Spartz](http://kyle.marek-spartz.org) will continue to walk
through [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48
Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours), a
[Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page) that introduces Haskell. [Last time](http://www.haskellmn.org/posts/2016-02-11-february-haskellmn-meetup.html) we got through the [Parsing chapter](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/Parsing). We'll start with a quick review of everything up to that point, and then proceed with the first [Evaluation chapter](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/Evaluation,_Part_1).

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/230045233/).
