The January HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, January 20,
2016, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](https://www.govdelivery.com/) on the
sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

This month, [Tyler Holien](https://twitter.com/tylerholien) is going to talk
about techniques for increasing reliability by encoding more information in the
type system, using examples from ongoing improvements to
[milena](https://github.com/tylerholien/milena), a
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) client for Haskell.

We'll also chat about what projects we've been working on over the last couple
months.

FYI: Saint Paul street parking is no longer free after 5pm, so you should be
able to park closer to the Hamm building, but you'll have to pay for that.

Please RSVP either on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/221323298/).
