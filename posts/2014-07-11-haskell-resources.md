Here is a list of links that were mentioned as good resources for learning Haskell at our last meetup.

Chris Allen ([\@bitemyapp](https://twitter.com/bitemyapp)) created a great resource for learning Haskell. This is a great place to start: [https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell/blob/master/README.md]()

An awesome (and huge) resource - good for beginners and more experienced/intermediate Haskellers: [http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/]()

Brent Yorgey taught an intro to Haskell course and put the lectures online for free. He also created an interactive tutorial on FP Complete:

 - [Lectures](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html)
 - [Tutorial](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/introduction-to-haskell)


### Books

- [http://learnyouahaskell.com/]()
- [http://book.realworldhaskell.org/]() (related: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23727768/which-part-of-real-world-haskell-is-now-obsolete-or-considered-bad-practise]())
- [https://www.apress.com/9781430262503]()
- Chris Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures - Not specific to Haskell, but a great read. The book version is not free, but his theses is very readable: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/theses/okasaki.pdf]()
