The July HaskellMN Meetup will be Wednesday, July 16, 2014, 7-9 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/) on the sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102).

We'll review what we did in the split groups [last month](/posts/2014-06-27-events-predating-the-blog.html), then split
again into an introductory group and continuing work on
[our Twitter bot](https://github.com/HaskellMN/haskell-mn-twitter-bot).
Feel free to switch groups if you felt you were in the wrong one last
month, or if you didn't attend last month, join in where you feel
comfortable. If you have questions you'd like
answered at the event, please open an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/HaskellMN/beginners-night-questions/issues),
or ask on the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn)
or on the
[Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/191666152/).
