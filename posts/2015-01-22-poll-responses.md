HaskellMN is a small, but growing community. Here's some information about who
we are and what we are interested in.

## Meetup Chart

Growth in membership typically outpaces growth in attendance by a few months.
The drop at the end is likely due to a lack of a December meetup. The labels may
seem to be offset; January's activity levels are not yet on the graph, and will
likely be similar to November's.


## Google Forms Poll

We had a beginning-of-the-year membership poll to allow for decisions to be made
based on our members' interests. We had 14 responses out of 57 registered Meetup
members, for a nearly 25% participation rate; these results are likely
representative (or at least representative of members who take polls).
