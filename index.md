Hello! We are a user group for the [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/)
programming language located in Minnesota.

Please see our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/) and
[Google](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn) groups for
more information.


# Upcoming events:

- Wednesday, May 14, 2014:
    - We'll be meeting from 6 to 8 pm at [GovDelivery](http://www.govdelivery.com/), Sixth floor of the Hamm Building (408 St Peter St, St Paul, MN 55102). Thanks to Tyler for our new location! This one has a projector, so we'll be celebrating with lightning talks. If you have a talk you'd like to give (or see), please tell us on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskellmn) or on the
      [Meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/HaskellMN/events/181725802/).
